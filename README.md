[Supernova](https://supernova.io) is a design system platform that manages your assets, tokens, components and allows you to write spectacular documentations for your entire teams. And because you found your way here, you are probably interested in its most advanced functionality - automatic hand-off of design and development assets, tokens and data in general. To learn everything Supernova, please check out our [developer documentation](https://developers.supernova.io/).

# Design Tokens Format Module Exporter

The Design Tokens Format Module Exporter allows you to **convert Supernova tokens and styles into design token module format by W3C DTCG**, so you can freely integrate them with other tools supporting this format. You can generate DTCG format definitions either manually - on demand - using Supernova's [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SupernovaIO.pulsar-vsc-extension), or automate your code delivery pipeline using Supernova [Design Continuous Delivery](https://supernova.io/automated-code-delivery).


## Example Usage

Once you have run the exporter against your design system, you can start using the code in your codebase right away. Exporter creates the following definitions:

- [x] `colors.json` containing all colors tokens
- [x] `typography.json` containing all typography classes
- [x] `shadows.json` containing all shadow tokens
- [] `gradients.json` containing all gradient tokens
- [] `measures.json` containing all measure tokens
- [] `radii.json` containin all radius tokens

Each of the `.json` files can be used inside other tools. The exporter properly follows the structuring of the tokens inside respective categories, adding groups as nesting inside the definition:

```
{
  "color": {
    "ui-elements": {
      "primary": {
        "$value": "#4589ffff",
        "$type": "color"
      },
      "success": {
        "$value": "#00a454ff",
        "$type": "color"
      },
      "critical": {
        "$value": "#d23031ff",
        "$type": "color"
      }
   }
}
```

In this case, `critical` token was defined inside `Colors` category, in `success` group. Of course, the exporter also properly exports references when you used token aliasing inside Supernova:

```

{
  "color": {
    "ui-elements": {
      "primary": {
        "value": "#4589ffff",
        "type": "color"
      },
      "primary-copy": {
        "value": "{color.ui-elements.primary.value}",
        "type": "color"
      },
   }
}
```

Finally, if you are tokens using mixins - such as using `measure` tokens inside typography, the exporter draws from those as well and **will properly export all references**, even across different definition trees. This way, everything you defined in Supernova is **always** exported.

### Descriptions

If you are using token descriptions, the exporter includes them under `comment` key:

```
{
  "text": {
    "welcome-screen": {
      "sign-in": {
        "$value": "Please Sign In",
        "$type": "text",
        "$description": "Use this everywhere user creates a new account"
      },
      "sign-out": {
        "$value": "Sign Out from the application",
        "$type": "text"
      },
      "forgot-password": {
        "$value": "Did you forget your password?",
        "$type": "text"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Multi-line descriptions are also supported, and will be exported with `\n` where newline occurs. If the token doesn't have a description, the `comment` key is not generated.

### Known limitations

- Typography tokens exports only values that are supported by the Design Tokens Format Module, not for all typography properties that we have in Supernova. Missing typoraphy values: (tbd)
